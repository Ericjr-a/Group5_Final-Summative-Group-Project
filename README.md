# Group5_Final-Summative-Group-Project
This project makes use of deep nural network and convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs.
Our model was trained using a German Traffic Sign dataset
Our Traffic Sign Detection application use the ResNet50 pre-trained model, a convolutional neural network, to identify various traffic signs from images.
 The capability of this model is beneficial for autonomous driving systems and traffic monitoring applications.
 To get started with our application, users need to clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages as shown in our source code . Additional libraries may be needed based on the environment the user is going to utilize .Our application trains on a dataset of traffic signs, categorized in different folders.The model is trained based on the desired parameters.

For deployment,we used streamlit to deploy our program.
Requirements for our deployment :
streamlit==1.10.0
opencv-python==4.5.5.62
numpy==1.22.3
matplotlib==3.5.1
keras==2.8.0
Pillow==9.0.1
